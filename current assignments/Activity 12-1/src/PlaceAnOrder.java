/*
A company accepts user orders for its products interactively. Users might make the following errors as they enter data:

The item number ordered is not numeric, too low (less than 0), or too high (more than 9999).
The quantity is not numeric, too low (less than 1), or too high (more than 12).
The item number is not a currently valid item.

Create an application that contains prompts for an item number and quantity.
Allow for the possibility of non-numeric entries as well as out-of-range entries and entries that do not match any of the currently available item numbers.

The program should display an appropriate message if an error has occurred.
If no errors exist in the entered data, compute the userâ€™s total amount due (quantity times price each) and display it.
