/*
In this module you will implement a binary heap. A binary heap is a collection of keys arranged in a complete heap-ordered binary tree,
represented in a level-ordered array (not using the first entry). A binary tree is heap-ordered the key in each node is larger or equal to the keys in that node's children (if any).

For this implementation we will use an array of characters to hold the keys.
Also, we will use the implementation where the first element in the array (heap[0]) is not used.
The first element of the heap will be in the array, at heap[1].

Also, for this implementation since we are dealing with arrays we want to try and be efficient with the amount of space we are using.
So, our Max-heaps will be initialized with only two elements. That means there will only be room for one key at the start.
Remember, we will not be using the first element in our implementation. Every time we run out of space in the array we will double the size of the current array, so we can fit more elements.
This will prevent us from running out room and those irritating "out-of-bounds" errors.

The input for this program will be from the keyboard and accept single-characters, which represent the keys for the heap.

For characters, 'A'-'Z': Add the key to the heap.
For the character, '*': Print the key with the maximum value (root) and delete the key with the maximum value, from the heap. Deleting from an empty heap is ignored.
For the character, '#': Print all the keys currently in the heap using heap-order (level-order) traversal.
For the character, '!': Print all the keys currently in the heap using post-order traversal.
Ignore all other characters.

You cannot modify any code given in the starter file.
You can add any code you wish except 5 & 6 below.
Do not assume any maximum length for any input string.
You need not test for the null or empty string ("") case.
You are not allowed to add any arrays or ArrayLists  or any Java built-in (ADTs), such as Trees, Graphs, or Heaps. Or add any class that inherits any of those ADTs.
You are not allowed to use Java Generics.
If hard-coding detected in any part of your solution your score will be zero for the whole assignment.

***notes***
A Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with following properties.
1) Itâ€™s a complete tree (All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible). This property of Binary Heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array.

(i/2) parent node
(i*2) left child
(i*2) + 1 right child
